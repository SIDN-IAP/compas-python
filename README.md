# COMPAS analysis in Python
We aim to redo Propublica analysis in Python. This project was created for the [MIT Structure and Interpretation of Deep Networks IAP class](http://sidn.csail.mit.edu/).

For more detailed information about the COMPAS dataset and the derivations, I encourage you to check out the [Propublica repo](http://sidn.csail.mit.edu/).
